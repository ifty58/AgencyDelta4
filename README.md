Example of how the site functions:

1. I am someone who drives to Ballston Metro daily for work.  I live in an apartment complex and see many of my neighbors walking or taking the bus.  I would like to offer them a ride, if there was only a way.


2. I am someone who drives to Walmart in Tysonâ€™s Corner.  I see many people taking the bus to go shopping at this specific Walmart.  I would like to offer them a ride, but also specify the number of hours I will be shopping so they understand from what time we will go and what time we will be coming back.


3. Out of the spur of the moment I am going to visit family in Los Angeles, CA.  It would be cool to offer someone a lift on my way out to the west coast.  I am starting from Washington, D.C. and would like to site to upload a picture of my route and see if anyone is interested in a ride.
